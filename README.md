# Labs: CSS Frameworks
This repository contains a JSON file (see `items.json`) which lists CSS
frameworks. This is used extensively in our product
[https://css-frameworks.com/](https://css-frameworks.com/), which allows you
to quickly preview and demo different CSS frameworks.

Feel free to use this data (licensed under MIT) for your own projects (and
submit a PR to this `README.md` file so we can link to your project).
